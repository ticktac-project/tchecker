## Description

This is TChecker, an *open-source* model-checker for timed systems. TChecker is
written in C++17 and provides a library of classes to describe timed systems,
to compute the corresponding timed automata, to compute its semantics, as well
as symbolic representations and algorithms to check requirements over timed
systems. It also comes with tools to run these algorithms from the command
line.

TChecker originates and is still lead by academic research on the verification
of timed systems. It is intended to serve as a plateform to experiment new data
structures and algorithms for the verification and the synthesis of timed
systems. The goal of the project is to implement state-of-the-art algorithms as
well as benchmarks to evaluate these algorithms, and to share then with the
community.
